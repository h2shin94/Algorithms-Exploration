Initial idea

Best way to retrieve / search a set of keys is if they are in order. We can do binary search with takes logarithmic time.
On disk we could have an ordered set of each key, so that given the key we look I the file with the correct set of keys and binary search to find the right key, then look at the associated address location for the corresponding data value.
